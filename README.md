# Regional-Power
Regional Power is a political, economic, and social simulation game with deep mechanics, micro-management, influence systems, and strategic decision-making.

You play as a character living in an alternate-reality Ukraine, starting in the year 2007. Choose your path: become a politician, businessperson, criminal figure, or public influencer. The world reacts to your actions â€” from relationships with NPCs to market fluctuations and political shifts.

Key Features:

Fully interactive UI styled as an operations center.

Custom economy, influence, trust, and reputation systems.

Event system with meaningful choices and dynamic consequences.

Asset and ownership management, including businesses and partnerships.

Built with Python and Pygame

This project is in active development. Current focus: concept design and core simulation mechanics.
